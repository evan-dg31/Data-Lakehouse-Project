# Data Lakehouse and Analytics Project - Formula 1

Welcome to the Data Lakehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a modern Data Lakehouse architecture and analytics solution, from building a data lakehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights best practices in data engineering and analytics showcasing hands-on experience with:

- Building and managing a Data Lakehouse
- Data ingestion, transformation, and modeling
- Implementing ELT pipelines
- Creating insightful dashboards and reports

### 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**:

1. **Raw Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV and JSON Files into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).
2. **Ingested Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, transformation, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis using Azure Databricks.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Aggregated data and houses business-ready data modeled required for reporting and analytics.

### Project Requirements
**Building the Data Lakehouse**

**Objective**

Develop a scalable and efficient batch data pipeline using Azure Databricks that ingests, cleans, transforms, and aggregates historical Formula 1 race data (e.g., lap times, pit stops, driver standings). The pipeline will support downstream analytics, reporting, and data science use cases such as performance benchmarking, race trend analysis, and predictive modeling.

✅ Key Components:

**Azure Data Factory (ADF)**:

- Automates and schedules data ingestion and ETL workflows
- Integrates with public Formula 1 datasets

**Azure Databricks**:

- Performs batch data transformations using PySpark or SQL
- Joins, aggregates, and enriches F1 datasets for downstream use

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Delta Lake)**:

- Stores raw and processed data in a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)
- Ensures ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and versioning

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources:** Import data from source systems (Ergast API) provided as CSV and JSON files
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus on the historical dataset.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### Objective
Develop SQL - based analytics to deliver detailed insghts into: 
- **Dominant Drivers**
- **Dominant Teams/Constructors**
- **Driver Standings**
- **Constructor Standings**

These insighst allows us to indentify and find pattern about the drivers and teams
